# Async: How to rock the technical interview

> **Presenter: Chris Dopuch**

This sessoin is usually syncronous, but due to that pesky Covid, we'll have to run this session asyncronously this time. [Watch this video of the previous "How to rock the technical interview" with Collab Lab mentor, Chris Dopuch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bzH-RLogy4), and reach out in the cohort channel if you have comments or questions. Cheers, friends!
