## Additional Resources

As you work your way through this program or once you have completed it, we encourage you to look into the [job search resources](https://github.com/the-collab-lab/job-search-resources) we've collected for you! You can think of this as a supplement to Career Lab - there's resources on topics we don't have time to cover in this program (like resume writing tips and resources for practicing coding challenges).
